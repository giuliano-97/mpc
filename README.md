# Temperature control of a refrigerated truck.

This repository contains the source code of the mini-project for the Model-Predictive control course of ETH Zurich - Spring Semester 2020. 

The script ```run_simulations.m``` simulates the systems and displayes the result using different controllers.

The code makes use of the MATLAB packages **Yalmip** and ***MPT3***.
