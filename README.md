# MPC programming exercise

## Setting things up

### Cloning your own branch

This is the **master** branch of the MPC programming exercise. 

I have already created a branch - named after your nethzid - for each of us.

To clone your branch, select your branch from the drop-down menu above
the tab where all files in the master branch are listed, then click on **clone**
on the right-hand side and copy the link under **Clone with HTTPS**.

If you already have a git client on your pc, you can skip this step. Otherwise,
download and install a git client like this one:

https://git-scm.com/download/win

Next, open your Git client. You can use either the Git Bash terminal or the 
Git GUI. 

If you want to use Git Bash (assuming you are using Windows),
simply go to the location where you would like to clone the repository
through File Explorer. Then right-click and select "Git Bash here" or something
like that and type in:\

    git clone <link you copied before>
    
And that's it.

If you want to use the GUI, just open it and click on "clone repository" and
follow the procedure.


### Committing & Pushing to your branch

If you are not familiar with the command line, you can just use the GUI.
